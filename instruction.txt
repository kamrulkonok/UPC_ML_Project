1. Merge Data
   - The `data` folder contains `airbnb_data.zip`.
   - Use this file to run the `Merge_Data.ipynb` notebook.
   - This notebook will merge the data into a single CSV file named `merged_airbnb_data.csv` in the `data` folder.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Use the `merged_airbnb_data.csv` generated from the `Merge_Data.ipynb` notebook.
   - Execute the `EDA.ipynb` notebook using this merged data.

3. Data Preprocessing
   - Use the `merged_airbnb_data.csv` from the `data` folder.
   - Execute the `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.
   - This notebook will save the preprocessed data as `preprocessed_airbnb_data.csv` in the `data` folder.
   
4. Modeling
   - Use the `preprocessed_airbnb_data.csv` from the `data` folder.
   - Execute the `Modeling.ipynb` notebook to perform the modeling.
